## Problem Statement
> Check the admin scratchpad! `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32267/` or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32267
## Hints
> What is that cookie?
> Have you heard of JWT?
## Solution
When we enter this link, we are greeted with a scratchpad web app of some type. It lets us through for any user besides "admin". When it does let us through, we see a cookie pop up in the Application tab of Chrome Developer tools called "jwt". This stores a long sequence of characters. If we search up "jwt", we find out that it is a JSON Web Token that is comprised of three components: the header, the payload, and the signature. If we decode the jwt cookie that we got at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/), we see from the header that this is a jwt that uses the HS256 algorithm. The payload is just one value: our username. We know that the correct username is "admin", as that is who the website does not let log in, but we don't know the signature. From here, we need to use JohnTheRipper, which is linked on the JaWT Scratchpad site under the name input. JohnTheRipper uses a brute force method to figure out the signature of jwt. However, it is very slow, as it has to go through so many possibilities. A better way is to use a word list. What a word list is is a dictionary of common secrets for JohnTheRipper to narrow down the possibilities and crack the signature faster. This could mean the difference between several hours and mere few seconds. A very strong word list is [rockyou](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt), which has a massive collection of common words. After running this, JohnTheRipper gets you the secret: `ilovepico`. You can go back to jwt.io and put it in along with the user in the payload being 'admin'. Insert this as your jwt cookie and login to bypass the portal and obtain the flag.
