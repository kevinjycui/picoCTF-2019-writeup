## Problem Statement
> There is a website running at `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21877/` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21877/)) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21877. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
## Hints
> There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
> Try to think about how does the website verify your login?
## Solution
When we open this site, we see the content of the main page is not very helpful. When we look at the Support page however, we see an inquiry saying `Hi. I tried adding my favorite Irish person, Conan O'Brien. But I keep getting something called a SQL Error`. This tells us that the site uses a SQL database. When we go to the Admin Login, we can try a basic SQL Injection to bypass the portal. Our injection is specifically having the username as `' OR 1=1--` and the password as whatever. The SQL query that checks the login is likely something like:
```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password';
```
When we put in our injection, the query becomes:
```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='';
```
What is happening here is the query checks if the username is equal to nothing. Then, it checks OR 1=1. Since 1 is always going to be equal to 1, this returns true. The -- at the end simply comments out the rest of the query. This fools the server into letting us through the portal.
