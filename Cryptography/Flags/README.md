## Problem Statement
> What do the [flags](flag.png) mean?
## Hints
> The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}
## Solution
When we view this image, we see a sequence of decorated squares. Upon seeing this, any navy enthusiast would immediately recognise the Internation Code of Signals. These signals are a common type of maritime flag signalling cryptography. Simply decode the signals to their respective uppercase characters and get the flag.
